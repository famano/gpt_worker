# Project Overview

This workspace directory is set up with a collection of Python scripts to automate task management and execution using AI. Specifically, it connects to OpenAI's API for intelligent response generation and task orchestration.

## Core Components

### tools.py
- **Purpose**: Defines classes for various tool operations required in task management, such as reading and writing files, updating state summaries, making plans, and executing scripts.
- **Key Classes**:
  - `FileReader`: Handles reading of files.
  - `FileWriter`: Manages writing content to files.
  - `StateUpdater`: Updates the state summary.
  - `ScriptExecutor`: Executes shell scripts if permitted by the user.
  - `PlanMaker`: Creates a list of tasks to be performed.

### main.py
- **Purpose**: A placeholder script that initiates the `main()` execution function.

### agents.py
- **Purpose**: Contains the agent classes that perform task automation by leveraging the tools.
- **Key Classes**:
  - `Planner`: Plans tasks using available tools.
  - `Worker`: Executes tasks based on prepared plans, uses tools for task management.
  - `Orchestrator`: Coordinates between Planner and Worker to ensure smooth workflow.

### connector.py
- **Purpose**: Handles connections to OpenAI's service, facilitating seamless integration for response and task execution.
- **Core Function**:
  - `OpenAIConnector`: Implements `CreateResponse` to interact with OpenAI's models and function tools.

## Additional Files
- **README.md**: Documentation file to provide an overview of this workspace.
- **reviewer.py**: Potentially supports reviewing or debugging tasks.
- **.gpt_worker Directory**: Likely contains configuration or state data.
- **__pycache__**: Stores bytecode cache files for Python, typically for performance optimization.

## Getting Started
This setup is configured to develop and test an automated task management framework using AI by interacting with OpenAI's API. Simply clone the repo, make sure you have the necessary API keys, and start the `main.py`.

Ensure to adjust configurations as needed and explore the core components to understand the framework structure better.
